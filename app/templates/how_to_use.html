<h2>How To Use 🎯🎯🎯</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Customers register by selecting their service type 🏦☕🏥🖥️</strong>. It’s as easy as picking your favorite flavor — except this one gets you served faster!</li>
  
  <li><strong>After registering, customers receive a ticket number 🎫🎟️🎫 and estimated wait time ⏳⌛⏰</strong>. Now you can chill, browse, or pretend you’re super busy without losing your spot.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Admins login 🔐🛡️🗝️ to manage the queue:</strong> call, skip, or reset tickets with a click — like a queue ninja at work 🥷🥷🥷.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Sound effects 🔔🎶🎵 notify admins</strong> when actions happen, adding a little pizzazz and keeping things lively (because boring queues are so last century).</li>
  
  <li><strong>Customers wait for their number to be called 📣📢📣</strong>, and latecomers get skipped automatically — so nobody keeps everyone else waiting (sorry, not sorry!).</li>
</ol>

  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep your phone handy, and maybe practice your victory dance — because your turn will come faster than you think! 🕺💃📱
