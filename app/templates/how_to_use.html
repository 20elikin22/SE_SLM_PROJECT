<h2>How To Use</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Customers register by selecting their service type</strong> (Banks, Cafes, Clinics, or Tech Support). It is as simple as choosing your preferred option and getting closer to being served promptly.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Upon registration, customers receive a ticket number along with an estimated wait time.</strong> This allows you to relax, browse, or attend to other matters without the risk of losing your place in the queue.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Administrators log in to manage the queue</strong> by calling, skipping, or resetting tickets with ease, effectively overseeing the flow like skilled professionals.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Subtle sound notifications alert administrators</strong> whenever actions occur, enhancing awareness and maintaining an engaging environment.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Customers wait for their number to be called.</strong> Late arrivals are automatically skipped to ensure the queue progresses smoothly and fairly for everyone involved.</li>
</ol>
